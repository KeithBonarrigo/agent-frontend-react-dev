      {
        "question": "Can I try it before committing to a paid plan?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. We offer a <strong>free trial</strong> so you can experience exactly how an AI agent works for your business <strong>before making any financial commitment</strong>. Set up your agent, test it with real scenarios, and see the results for yourself. We're confident that once you see the <strong>time saved and leads captured</strong>, you'll understand the value immediately."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will AI agents make my customer interactions feel impersonal?",
        "answer": "<strong>Not at all</strong>. Modern AI agents are designed to provide <strong>warm, conversational experiences</strong> that feel natural and helpful. They can remember customer preferences, use friendly language, and <strong>seamlessly hand off to human agents</strong> when a personal touch is needed. Many customers actually prefer the <strong>instant, judgment-free assistance</strong> AI provides for routine questions, while your team remains available for complex situations."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if the AI gives wrong information to my customers?",
        "answer": "AI agents are <strong>trained specifically on your business information</strong> and configured with guardrails to stay within their knowledge boundaries. When they encounter questions outside their scope, they're designed to <strong>acknowledge limitations and escalate to human support</strong> rather than guess. You maintain <strong>full control</strong> over the information they share, and continuous monitoring helps identify and correct any issues quickly."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is my business too small to benefit from AI agents?",
        "answer": "<strong>AI agents are particularly valuable for small businesses</strong> because they let you compete with larger companies without hiring additional staff. A solo entrepreneur can offer <strong>24/7 support</strong>, and a small team can handle inquiry volumes that would otherwise require multiple employees. Our <strong>tiered pricing</strong> means you only pay for what you need, making AI accessible regardless of your business size."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does it take to set up an AI agent?",
        "answer": "Most businesses have their AI agent <strong>live within minutes, not weeks</strong>. Our no-code platform lets you configure your agent by simply providing your business information and preferences. <strong>No technical expertise required</strong>, no developers to hire, and no complex integrations to manage. You can start capturing leads and answering customer questions <strong>the same day you sign up</strong>."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will I lose control over my customer relationships?",
        "answer": "You gain <strong>more control, not less</strong>. AI agents capture detailed information about every interaction, giving you insights into what customers are asking, what they need, and where they're coming from. <strong>You set the rules</strong> for how the AI responds, when it escalates, and what information it collects. <strong>Every conversation is logged and accessible</strong>, so you're always informed about what's happening with your customers."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens when the AI can't answer a question?",
        "answer": "<strong>Smart escalation is built into every AI agent.</strong> When a question falls outside the AI's knowledge or a customer requests human assistance, the conversation is <strong>seamlessly handed off to your team with full context</strong>. The AI can collect contact information and schedule callbacks, ensuring <strong>no inquiry falls through the cracks</strong> even outside business hours."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are AI agents secure? What about my customers' data?",
        "answer": "Security is foundational to our platform. All data is <strong>encrypted in transit and at rest</strong>, we never store payment card information, and we maintain strict compliance with privacy regulations. <strong>Your customer data belongs to you</strong> and is never used to train models or shared with third parties. We undergo <strong>regular security audits</strong> to ensure your information stays protected."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will my customers know they're talking to an AI?",
        "answer": "<strong>Transparency builds trust.</strong> Our AI agents can introduce themselves honestly while still providing excellent service. Research shows customers appreciate knowing they're interacting with AI when it means <strong>faster responses and 24/7 availability</strong>. The key is delivering genuine value—customers care far more about <strong>getting their questions answered quickly</strong> than whether a human or AI is helping them."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if AI technology changes and my investment becomes obsolete?",
        "answer": "Our platform <strong>continuously evolves with AI advancements</strong>, and your subscription includes all updates automatically. As the technology improves, your AI agent gets smarter <strong>without any additional effort or cost</strong> on your part. You're not locked into outdated technology—you're partnering with a platform committed to keeping you <strong>at the forefront of AI capabilities</strong>."
